        <p>"Just right," according to Bradley Miller. "Delicious and simple. Making sure the sugar is completely dissolved is very important for a great bananas foster."

            "I have made this for years," says Michelle Embrey Hembree. "It is so delicious! The only thing I do differently is substitute brandy for the rum. It's a favorite at my house. I usually make a double batch and it will all be gone that night or the next day."
            
            "Made this on the weekend with pecans and had to omit the vanilla (because I ran out), but it was so good," says LJ Shaw. "Used the remaining little bit on pancakes the next morning and I now have a new favorite pancake topper."</p>
